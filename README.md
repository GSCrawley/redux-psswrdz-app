## My Notes
Generating random integers in a range:
The Math.random() method returns a random number between 0 and 1.
the possible values could range from 0.0 to 0.999999999999...

...which you can then scale... To get a usable range of values you will need to multiply by a range. For example Math.random() * 6 would generate numbers from 0.0 to 5.999...

Often you will want a whole number. Since Math.random() generates a floating point number you will need to use some of the other Math functions to convert the floating point values into Integers. Math.round(), Math.floor(), Math.ceil() among others can do that.

The index of any element in an array is always an integer starting at 0 up to the length of the array - 1.

function random(n) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * n)
}
This function returns a whole number from 0 to n - 1.
Math.floor(n) rounds the value n down to a whole number. 
---------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
